# Push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions

<br />

## Game rules
- The game is composed of 2 stacks named a and b.  

- To start with: 
  - a contains a random number of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates.
  - b is empty

- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.

- To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:
  - sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
  - sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
  - ss : sa and sb at the same time.
  - pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
    nothing if b is empty.
  - pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
    nothing if a is empty.
  - ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
    the last one.
  - rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
  - rr : ra and rb at the same time.
  - rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one
